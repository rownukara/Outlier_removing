In statistics and data analysis, an outlier is an observation or data point that significantly deviates from the other observations in a dataset. Outliers can be unusual values that are either unusually high (positive outliers) or unusually low (negative outliers) compared to the majority of the data points.

Outliers can arise due to various reasons, including measurement errors, data entry mistakes, natural variations, or even rare events. They can have a significant impact on data analysis, statistical measures, and machine learning models. Outliers can distort the overall distribution, affect the accuracy of statistical estimates, and potentially influence the behavior of predictive models.
Removing outliers from a dataset is a common practice in data analysis and modeling for several reasons:

Preserving data quality: Outliers can arise due to errors or measurement issues. Removing outliers helps to improve the overall quality and integrity of the data. By eliminating extreme values that are likely to be incorrect or misleading, the dataset becomes more reliable and accurate.

Improving statistical analysis: Outliers can significantly impact statistical measures and distributions. Measures such as the mean and standard deviation are highly sensitive to outliers. Removing outliers can help ensure that statistical measures accurately represent the central tendency and dispersion of the data.

Mitigating the impact on model performance: Outliers can have a disproportionate influence on the outcome of statistical models and machine learning algorithms. They can bias the model's estimation and lead to suboptimal results. Removing outliers can help improve the model's performance by reducing the influence of extreme values and improving the overall fit.

Preserving model assumptions: Many statistical techniques and models assume that the data follow certain assumptions, such as normality or linearity. Outliers can violate these assumptions and impact the validity of the model. Removing outliers can help satisfy these assumptions and ensure the model's validity.

Enhancing interpretability: Outliers can distort the interpretation of the data and relationships between variables. By removing outliers, the relationships and patterns within the data become more apparent and easier to interpret.
Outliers can be removed using various methods, including the Interquartile Range (IQR), Standard Deviation (STD), and Z-score. Here's a brief explanation of each method and how to use them to remove outliers:

1.Interquartile Range (IQR) method: The IQR is a measure of statistical dispersion and is calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1) of the data. According to this method, any data point outside the range (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR, Q3 + 1.5 * IQR) is considered an outlier and can be removed.
2.Standard Deviation (STD) method: This method uses the mean and standard deviation of the data to identify outliers. Data points that fall outside a certain number of standard deviations from the mean are considered outliers and can be removed. Typically, a threshold of 2 or 3 standard deviations is used.
3.Z-score method: The Z-score measures how many standard deviations an observation is away from the mean. Data points with a Z-score above or below a certain threshold are considered outliers.
